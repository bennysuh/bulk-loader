#summary The laundry list

===Testing===
  * Create a comprehensive test suite, so I can refactor code without fear of breaking stuff.
  * Add a "checkPolicy" to netstreams

  
===Features===
  * Chained loaders (an item that depends on multiples loads)
  * Refactor of LoadingItem so it can be extended easily.
  * JSON backend for serialized loading items.
