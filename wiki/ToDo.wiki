#summary The laundry list

  At this point, BulkLoader is pretty feature complete.
The areas where is needs more work are:
 * The LazyLoaders need to have the deserialization broken into smaller pieces, so that client code can intercept and work on data sources freely.
 * Documentation improvements. The docs are pretty complete, but it would be nice to have them revised, cross linked where feasible, etc.
 * Test Suite: although the converage is pretty good, there still is more to test.
