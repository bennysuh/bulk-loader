= Project Status =

I've used !BulkLoader in a cuple of projects. It's still under development but can be considered to be stable and reliable. 


= Details =

The aim of the next few revisions is to achieve API stability (we are pretty close to that). Once that is reached, we'll release version 0.9 and then fix eventual bugs until we get to 1.0.

If you find a bug, please let me know using the [http://code.google.com/p/bulk-loader/issues/list issue tracker] at google code.
